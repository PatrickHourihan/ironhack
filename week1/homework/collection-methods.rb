# IMPORTANT METHODS WE COVERED: 

# You can use each for pretty much every task you have to do with arrays.
# You can use map to transform all the items in an array to get a new one.
# You can use reduce to accumulate a single value from all the items.
# You can use select to remove items from an array easily.
# You can use find to pick out a single item in an array.
# You can use sort to change the order of an array.
